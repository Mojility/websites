# Mojility Websites

I've got a number of websites I manage under Mojility, and this repository gathers everything together for me.

I've revamped the web properties to run under Gatsby, and deploy statically to AWS.

If you're endeavouring to do something similar, feel free to use this repository to assist your learning. And pay it forward, this is the way.

Thanks to the [Gatsby community](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and my colleague [David Sabine](https://scrum.works/) for giving me the jumpstart I needed to start putting this together in 2019.
